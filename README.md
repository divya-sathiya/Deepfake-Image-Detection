# Deepfake Image Detection

In recent times, concerns about the advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have been growing rapidly. AI-generated content has become increasingly sophisticated, raising various issues such as plagiarism, privacy violations, job displacement, and malicious use. One notable area of AI-generated content is images, particularly Deepfakes. Deepfakes use deep learning techniques, especially generative adversarial networks, to create or alter facial appearances. Detecting these Deepfakes, or classifying images as either real or AI-generated, is a critical and timely challenge. This work aims to compare and evaluate two different approaches to this problem, potentially offering suggestions for improvement.
